# rs-hangman

Hangman, written in Rust, by me.

Loosely based on my [py-hangman](https://github.com/RiderExMachina/py-hangman) game.

### Goals
- [x] Select a word from an internal list 
    - [x] Randomly if possible
    - [ ] Also account for an already existing wordlist
- [x] Enumerate the length of the word with spaces to show the length
- [x] List which letters have been guessed
- [ ] Show remaining guesses
